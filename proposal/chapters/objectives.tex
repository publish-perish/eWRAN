%\begin{itemize}	
%	\item \emph{How can the general overall goal be broken down into subgoals?}
%	\item \emph{What are the planned contributions and how will they close the research gaps?}
%	\item \emph{What will be rendered possible upon completion of this thesis.}
%\end{itemize}

We generalize our overall goals into simple steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Step 0: Determine the problem.
	\item Step 1: Formulate the relevant graph models using appropriate abstraction.
	\item Step 2: Establish the existence/uniqueness of differential tensor/flow .
	\item Step 3: Implement a python/ruby module/scaffolding to model to aid in prototyping
    conditions to define (possible) deterministic systems. 
	\item Step 4: Based on the analytical results, implement various systems' tensorflow.
\end{itemize}

Upon completion of this thesis, we hope to recognize new patterns in the
decision-making process and associated noise process. The system's graph-theoretical basis indicates that, depending on
the system's derivations and resulting coefficients, that a (new) coloring is not impossible.
