\section*{Abstract}

We intend to develop a
dynamic visualization of the decision process using a game-theoretical
framework.

Given a stochastic arrival process, we define a subset of the field of
right-continuous, left-limited \emph{cadlag} 
functions, and show there exists a mapping of a variation of strategies to a time-dependent
arrangement, where we may then apply our statistical game theoretic approach.
We conjecture that the choice of arrangement and random process results in a
proximity/incidence graph with nice properties.

We address our strategies as a finite set of actions, and attempt to formalize
the $\mathcal{C}\lbrack\tau \times \tau\rbrack$ immersion by defining a sphere-of-
influence (SIG) graph. To begin, we propose a set of mixed strategies defined by a probability
distribution over the finite set of feasible strategies, and define a basic game
played by intelligent players.
We define a decision model, determined by a drift-diffusion process, and use a mean field theorem to prove the existence of a dense strategy
space via inverse map, and examine the evolution of the resulting compacted strategy space.
