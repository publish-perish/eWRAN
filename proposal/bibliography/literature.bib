\subsection{Foundational Literature}

A literature review that includes historical
papers would give perspective and formalization, and determine the foundation
upon which to work. Some considerations are:\\
$[1]$ M. E. Bratman. Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason. CSLI Publications, Stanford University, 1987.\\
$[2]$ I. Gilboa and E. Zemel. Nash and correlated equilibria: Some complexity
considerations. Games and Economic Behavior, 1:80-93, 1989.\\
$[3]$ E. Kalai. Games, computers, and O.R. In ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 1995.\\
$[4]$ Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen. Algorithmic mechanism design. In Proc. 31st ACM Symp. on
Theory of Computing, pages 129-140, 1999.\\

inefficient proofs of existence. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 48(3):498-532, 1994.\\
