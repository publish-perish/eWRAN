Let the arrival process have Poisson distribution
$$
    \mathbb{P}\lbrace L_i = k\rbrace = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!} = f^k(t) \ dt.
$$

Let there be a partition function $Z:\mcS \times \mcS\rightarrow \mcS$, 
and fix the mixed strategy vector, $[s] = [s_1, \cdots, s_N] \in
\mcS\times\mcS$.
TODO: FIX THIS NONSENSE!\\
The probability that $[s]$ is the equilibrium state is,
$$
    \mathbb{P}([s]) = \displaystyle\sum_{s_i \in [s]} \frac{1}{Z} e^{-s
    (r_i^2)},
$$
with expected utility, $\mathbb{E}([s]) = \displaystyle\sum_{[s]} \pi_i
\mu(r_i)$.



We address a scenario where the standards assumed by the IEEE 802.22 draft for
wireless regional access networks (WRAN) are not supported. Namely, incomplete
provider (PU) data. This
scenario, as an example, could occur as a result of incomplete or corrupted
infrastructure. Further, we model the presence of a
powerful adversary and investigate WRAN operations in the worst case, where the
adversary has fully infiltrated the primary user's (PU) broadcast
spectrum. We propose a heirarchical game theoretic structure for resource allocation 
and investigate the ability of the WRAN to protect itself
and its cognitive nodes (CRs) from attack. 


The strategies of the eCRs, within  framework, allow us to complete the
metric on the space of cadlag functions restricted to $\mcL \in \mathbb{Z}^n$.
We represent the bijection $\mcL \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{n+}$ as the exterior of
the stationary set (probability distribution, but which one? density?) of the eCR strategies. 


Thus, $\mcL_i< \infty$ almost surely and $\mathbb{E}(L_i) = \sigma \cdot L_i =
\lambda$. 

In $\mcL\subset\mathbb{Z}^+$, this is the length of the shortest queue.

Before we arrive at the Stackelberg game, we make use of the flexibility of the
CRN to form a network topology based on the interconnectedness and resulting
strategies of the eCRs.
