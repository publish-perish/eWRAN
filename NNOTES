Negative binomial stitching needs a pipi trace

Use the mathematical description of parallelism



While in Euclidean geometry two geodesics can either intersect or be parallel, in hyperbolic geometry, there are three possibilities. Two geodesics belonging to the same plane can either be:

intersecting, if they intersect in a common point in the plane,
parallel, if they do not intersect in the plane, but converge to a common limit point at infinity (ideal point), or
ultra parallel, if they do not have a common limit point at infinity.
In the literature ultra parallel geodesics are often called non-intersecting. Geodesics intersecting at infinity are called limiting parallel.

2 pi delta K le delta S

2 pi (tr rho K - tr rho S|_v) le delta S

Note: tr is pure imaginary 

subgroup of the cadlags is a homeomorphy to the 2 tau^K 
-> the subspace topology is simply connected

-> [s] is a Lie algebra -> S times S is a Lie group

by Schur's lemma an intertwining map
phi mapsto S times S, is either 0, isomorphism

ergot, if s is in the null space of the ball, then there exists an identity
operator s.t. pi(kappa(s) mapsto [s]

A homeomorphism is simultaneously an open mapping and a closed mapping; that is, it maps open sets to open sets and closed sets to closed sets

The Newlanderâ€“Nirenberg theorem shows that an almost complex structure is actually a complex structure precisely when these subbundles are involutive, i.e., closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields, and such an almost complex structure is called integrable
