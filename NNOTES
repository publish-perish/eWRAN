Negative binomial stitching needs a pipi trace

Use the mathematical description of parallelism

2 pi delta K le delta S

2 pi (tr rho K - tr rho S|_v) le delta S

Note: tr is pure imaginary 

subgroup of the cadlags is a homeomorphy to the 2 tau^K 
-> the subspace topology is simply connected

-> [s] is a Lie algebra -> S times S is a Lie group

by Schur's lemma an intertwining map
phi mapsto S times S, is either 0, isomorphism

ergot, if s is in the null space of the ball, then there exists an identity
operator s.t. pi(kappa(s) mapsto [s]


Lie operator := []


A homeomorphism is simultaneously an open mapping and a closed mapping; that is, it maps open sets to open sets and closed sets to closed sets

The Newlanderâ€“Nirenberg theorem shows that an almost complex structure is actually a complex structure precisely when these subbundles are involutive, i.e., closed under the Lie bracket of vector fields, and such an almost complex structure is called integrable
