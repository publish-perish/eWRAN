Group velocities - the velocity with which the envelope of a weak narrow-band optical pulse propagates in a medium
- defined as the inverse of the derivative of the wavenumber w.r.t. angular
frequency

Intermodal dispersion - the phenomenon that the group velocity of light propagating in a waveguide structure depends on the waveguide mode
