%1 TODO:\\
1. Define the complex number transform (use stereographic projection)\\
2. Assign values to $x,y,z$ \\
a. $x^2+y^2=r^2$, where $r$ is the no. queues with length $\ge k$. \\
b. levi-civita symbols (can have skew-symmetric matrix with spinors)\\
3. get complex field with Lie topology
4. get complex euclidean manifold
5. examine uncertainties vs. replicator model
It follows that $\phi(\cdot) \mapsto \mathbb{C}$, defined by a bijection 
from ball $S_i$ to an angle $\theta$ on the complex plane.


. show fitness matrix
. show cost function is convex
. show that step function maps to complex plane theta
. define total variation
. define metric
. define tensors -> flow?
. show mapping from theta to inner product space (surface)
. get n-sphere
. map fitness to skew matrix on surface
. get functional derivative
. show point at infty (cadlag) -> submersion


%2 \textbf{Proof:} 
Let $c_1 < c_2 \cdots < c_n$ be the costs associated with eCRs $\brace 1,\cdots,
n\rbrace$ in queue $k$. Fix time $t$ and let $\mu(\cdot)$ be defined as
$\max_{s_i\in Q}$ The inverse $\frac{1}{c_i} \approx 
\theta\mathbb{P}(\mcS)$. % UPPER BOUND
OUTLINE : (1) $c_k$ is the CDF of the $\mathbb{C}$ projection\\
(2) Per (CITE) we only need $\hat c$ to be cadlag, and both tails on the\\
$x$-axis (CAN WE CREATE THE SYMMETRY HERE?, NEED DYNAMICAL SYSTEM MODEL
($\phi$)\\
(3) Examine the convexity, concavity of the $\mcL$-forms (L-style junctions)!
Line can be obscured by overlapping objects, i.e. the overlapping radio range.

We introduce a transform $\gamma: \mcS \rightarrow \mcS$ such that,
$\gamma: s_i(\mcL) \rightarrow [0,1]^2$ such that,
$$
    \gamma(s_i \in \mcS) = \gamma\bigg(\displaystyle\sum_{s_1}^{s_i} \pi_{L_i} \bigg)-
    \gamma\bigg(\displaystyle\sum_{s_1}^{s_{i-1}}\pi_{L_i}\bigg) = 1,
$$
and extend the arrangement $s_1<s_2<\cdots s_N$ to the trihedral plane. 
Fix $s_{-i}\in \mcS$, and let the expected \emph{marginal value} of $L_i$ be,
$$
    V(L_i,s_{-i}) = \displaystyle\sum_{L_i\in s_{-i}\in \mcS}\mathbb{E}[C(L_i, L_{-i})
$$
Let $\theta$ be a step-function such that, for cost $c, \hat c$, 
$$
    \theta_i = \arctan\bigg(\frac{c}{\hat c}\bigg),
$$
then,
We show that $V(\cdot)$ forms a convex kernel with a left limit.
