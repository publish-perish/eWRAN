$u=\frac{rx}{r-z}$ and $v=\frac{ru}{r-z}$. The Riemann metric induced by $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by,
$$
    dr^2 = \frac{4r^4(du^2 + dv^2)}{(r^2 + u^2 + v^2)^2}.
$$

Let the queue of players be such that
$Q_k = \lbrace L_1 \le L_2 \le\cdots \le L_n\rbrace \subset \mcL$, and a weight
$\pi$, so that queue $k$ satisfies,
$$
    W(Q_k) = \displaystyle\sum_{L\in Q_k} \pi \frac{\nu(L)}{n},
$$ 
where $\nu:\mcL \rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and $\pi_i\in [0,1]$ is a probability weight such
that $\sum_{j \in \vert L\vert}\pi_j = 1$. 


Restricting the sample space $\mcL\subset\mathbb{Z}^+$, suppose $\mcL_i(\cdot)\in \mcS$ is a given
non-decreasing step-function where the cost $L_i(c)$ is such that $c_1\le \cdots \le c_n$, and so $L_i(c) = l$ for $c_{l-1}\le c \le c_l$. 
Define a metric $\rho(L_1(\cdot), L_2(\cdot)) \equiv \vert\vert s_{L_1} -
s_{L_2}\vert\vert$. 


Define the total
variational norm, where $f$ is any cadlag function,
$$
    \vert\vert \nu\vert\vert_{TV} = \sup\lbrace \int f \ d\nu : \vert\vert
    f\vert\vert_\infty \le 1 \rbrace.
$$



Let $\Lambda$ define the class of strictly increasing continuous mappings of
$[0,1]$ that are self-onto, i.e. self-coherent. For any $\lambda \in \Lambda$,
define the unit exponential function to be a mapping from the space of
continuous probabilty under uncertainty to the discrete possible space. Thus, we
define the metric, 
$$
\vert \lambda \vert = \sup \limits_{u\rightarrow s}\frac{\lambda\rightarrow u}{s}.
$$

TODO:
Put corollary where it goes.


    \emph{Corollary:}
    Every complex submanifold of a Kahler mainfold is volume minimizing in its
    homology class. Therefore the eCRs will decrease in entropy (uncertainty)
    based on a quasi-time-invariant evolution. 


Q? Does learning = believing?

TODO: Need well-defined starting point (pure field of identical know-nothings)
Define the stages, is one perceptron enough? 

GRAPHS

The boxicity of a graph is the minimum dimension in which a given graph can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-parallel boxes. That is, there must exist a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the graph and a set of boxes, such that two boxes intersect if and only if there is an edge connecting the corresponding vertices.

A graph has boxicity at most one if and only if it is an interval graph; the boxicity of an arbitrary graph G is the minimum number of interval graphs on the same set of vertices such that the intersection of the edges sets of the interval graphs is G.

EVOLUTION

Evolutionary game theory and its corresponding game dy- namics have also expanded well beyond their initial emphasis on single-species (i.e., symmetric) games with a finite set of (pure) strategies where payoffs result from random one-time interactions between pairs of individuals (also called “two-player symmetric normal form games” or, more simply, “matrix games”). In this paper, we briefly highlight some features of matrix games at the beginning of the following section before generalizing to other classes of symmetric games. These are population games, games with a continuum of pure strategies, and multiplayer games. We then consider two-player asymmetric games, including extensive form games (where pairs of individuals have a series of inter- actions with each other and the set of actions available at later interactions may depend on what choices were made in earlier ones) as well as asymmetric population games and games with continuous strategy spaces.

The replicator equation arises if one equips a
certain game theoretical model for the evolution of
behaviour in animal conflicts with dynamics. It serves
to model many biological processes not only in sociobiology
but also in population genetics, mathematical
ecology and even in prebiotic evolution. 


Work = change in kinetic energy or neg change in potential energy
Power = amt work per unit time

In mathematics, Itô's lemma is an identity used in Itô calculus to find the differential of a time-dependent function of a stochastic process. It serves as the stochastic calculus counterpart of the chain rule. It can be heuristically derived by forming the Taylor series expansion of the function up to its second derivatives and retaining terms up to first order in the time increment and second order in the Wiener process increment.

WRAN

Since WRAN systems are for fixed operation,
transmission channels are expected to change
very slowly, so there is little time diversity gain
to be achieved through burst allocation across
different symbols. Therefore, the downstream
bursts in IEEE 802.22 will be allocated progressively
across subchannels in the frequency
domain, as depicted in Fig. 3, to minimize overhead
by simplifying the downstream map. This
will also contribute to reducing decoding latency.
The upstream bursts will be allocated progressively
across symbols to minimize the number of
subchannels used by CPE, hence reducing the
instantaneous effective isotropic radiated power
(EIRP) to mitigate interference to incumbent
systems. The upstream bursts can also be
mapped on a 7-symbol column basis, as shown i


There are three types of preamble defined in
WRAN:, superframe preamble, frame preamble,
and CBP preamble, in order to facilitate burst
detection, synchronization, and channel estimation.
All three preambles are one OFDM symbol
long in time with 1/4 cyclic prefix.
All CPEs synchronize to a BS, in time and
frequency, using the superframe preamble, which
consists of four repetitions of a short training
sequence (STS) following the cyclic prefix. The
frame preamble is used for synchronization,
channel estimation, frequency offset estimation,
and received power estimation. It consists of two
repetitions of a long training sequence (LTS).
The CBP preamble is used for CBP detection,
synchronization, frequency offset estimation, and
CBP channel estimation. It has the same structure
as the superframe preamble but uses a different
STS to be distinct from the superframe
preamble with low cross-correlation.
In order to obtain robust channel estimation

The elementary unit for resource allocation is
the subchannel, which consists of 28 subcarriers
with 24 data subcarriers and 4 pilot subcarriers.
There are a total of 60 subchannels in each
OFDM symbol.

. In the upstream, two subchannels
will be reserved for ranging, bandwidth
request message, or UCS notification.
 The
remaining subchannels will be interleaved with
block size 1624 (28 × 58), including both pilot
and data. The frequency interleaving algorithms
for upstream and downstream are the same as
the bit interleaving algorithm, but with different
parameters. The inclusion of pilots in the interleaving
process in the upstream direction is to
ensure that every CPE burst that arrives at the
BS will have one pilot on each subcarrier over
the period of seven OFDMA symbols, which is
the minimum upstream burst length. On the
other hand, the exclusion of pilots in the interleaving
process in the downstream is to allow
fast channel estimation (using fewer than seven
OFDM symbols) at CPEs to allow for delay-sensitive
applications

If it is established that WRAN operation on
channel N may create interference to a broadcast
incumbent operating on a related channel,
the SM will have the following four options:
• Reduce the EIRP of the CPE by placing a
limit on the transmit power control (TPC)
range to eliminate the interference in their
local area.
• If such a decrease in CPE EIRP renders the
service unsustainable, disallow these CPE
units (i.e., these CPE units need to seek
service on another channel from the same
or a different service provider).
• Reduce the EIRP of the BS transmission to
eliminate the potential interference.
• In many cases a reduction in the BS EIRP
will no longer allow proper WRAN operation
with distant CPE, and the SM will need
to initiate a channel move (to its first backup
channel) involving the BS and all of its
associated CPE.
There will always be a manual override at the
BS in the unlikely event that an unexpected
interference situation occurs. It is assumed that
the WRAN operator will have the ultimate
responsibility for avoiding interference to incumbents.
Any special event will be handle

Another requirement of the 802.22 draft standard
is that the BS must have access to an
incumbent database service. This service provides
accurate and up-to-date information
describing protected broadcast operation in the
area
