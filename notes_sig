We have the tangent line of the arrival process of eCRs sampling $L_i$ queues at price $c$
$$
    \lambda s_{-i}(L_i)(r_{L_i}(c-1) - r_{L_i}(c).
$$
Using the tangent lines, we begin a tesselation process on $SIG_i$, a collection of mobius triangles which are oriented perpendicular to the direction of flux, and define a map projection $\varphi(SIG(mathbb{B}(\cdot)))$ as a minimization of the Dirichlet energy, 
$$
	E[\mu]  = \frac{1}{2} \displaystyle\int_{\mcS}
    \vert\vert\triangledown\mu(s)\vert
    \vert^2 \ dV,
$$


{\lemma{The Enveloping Algebra}\\
We extend the arrangement $s_1<s_2<\cdots s_N$ to the trihedral plane. Fix
$s_{-i}\in \mcS$, and let the \emph{marginal value} of $L_i$ be,
$$
    V(L_i,s_{-i}) = 
$$
if and only if there exists a strategy vector $[s]$, and a function $\phi$ such
that $\phi(s_i) =
C((-\infty,s_i]), \ i = 1,2,\cdots, N$ and $\phi(s_1) <
\phi(s_2) < \cdots < \phi(s_N)$. The union of these sets form an
algebra $[\alpha s] \subset \mcS\times\mcS$.
}\\
\textbf{Proof:} 
Let $c_1 < c_2 \cdots < c_n$ be the costs associated with eCRs $\brace 1,\cdots,
n\rbrace$ in queue $k$. Fix time $t$ and let $\phi(\cdot)$ be defined as
$\max_{s_i\in Q}$ The inverse $\frac{1}{c_i} \approx 
\theta\mathbb{P(\mcS)}$.
OUTLINE : (1) $\alpha_k$ is the CDF of 
$$ 
    \(s_i, s_{-i}) = \displaystyle\sum_{L_i \in [s_{-i}]_\times}
    \int_{c_{MIN}}^{c_{MAX}} V(L_i-1, s_{-i}),
$$
which we may interpret as the cumulative distribution function (CDF) across the
sample space $s_{\mcL} =\mcS\times \mcS$.



We have the $2$-sphere, TODO: collapse onto unit circle

\subsection{Enhanced Cognitive Structure}

The density matrix describing a mixed state is defined to be an operator of the form
$\rho =\sum _{s}p_{s}|\psi _{s}\rangle \langle \psi _{s}|$
where $p_{s}$ is the fraction of the ensemble in each pure
state $|\psi _{s}\rangle$ .
(this part needs the perceptron)
The ability of the CRN to reconfigure based on cognition of the environment
motivates us to construct our model as a study of momentum in a network between eCRs. 
We can think of this quantity as a measurement of flux passing through the
boundary of the ball $B_i$, although it is a positive quantity, the exterior of
the ball is a field with the same measure, and so although the field may have
velocity, there is no motivating factor as equilibrium is achieved at stasis.

We begin by examining the interactions between eCRs; initially, no queues have been
sampled and no pair interactions have occured.
Thus we model the pair interaction, and define the the player's initial utility
function as a hyberbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA), and so must adhere to,
for utility $\mu$,
$$
    \displaystyle\frac{\mu''(C(L_i,L_{-i}))}{\mu'(C(L_i,L_{-i}))}.
$$

We claim that there exists an additional, induced metric, on the
SIG. The the closed sphere of influence graph $SIG_i$ covers the intersections
of the closed balls $\mathbb{B}$.
$$
    \overline{B}_i= \lbrace X \in \mcX : \rho(X_i, X) \le r_i\rbrace.
$$


Let $\mcC^n$ be the extended complex plane, and so we have (DO WE?)
that $\mu(S_i, S_{-i}) \mapsto s_i^{-1}s_{-i}$ is a smooth mapping of the
product manifold  $\mcS\times\mcS$ onto $\mcS$, g


We define the closed graph $\overline{SIG_k}$ belonging to queue $k$.

\subsubsection{Sphere of Influence Graph (SIG)}
 We define the sphere of influence graph
(SIG) as a vertex set $\mcX$ and edge set 
$$
    \lbrace\lbrack s_i, s_j\rbrack : B_i \cap B_j \ne 0, i\ne j\rbrace.
$$
A SIG is \emph{simultaneously} a proximity graph and an intersection graph. 
We construct a map function and its closure in order to complete our
construction. The closed SIG graph forms a complete topology with respect to the
preference of its central eCR, 
within which we may make behavioral predictions. We define the SIG for an
eCR $i$, $SIG_i$ to be a set of vertices surrounding $i$, where another vertex
$j\in SIG_i$ probability of intersection is nonzero if and only if its core
$C_j$, is a subset of $SIG_i$ ((CHECK!). An intersection is defined to
be an interaction between the two eCRs (vertices) within a queue (CHECK!).
That is, the collection of balls who share an edge set at time $t$.
$$
    \mathbb{B} = \vert s_i \vert \le s_k \ \forall \ s_i \in S_i,
    s_k \in \mcS.
$$

Each ball represents a distribution of possible strategies, and as subset of the
measure space, we are able to compute its density function. 
Define the density operator $\rho$ on $\mcS\times \mcS$ as
$$
    \rho = \displaystyle\sum p_i\vert s_{L_i}\rangle\langle s_{L_i}\vert
$$
where $\vert s_i\rangle\langle s_i\vert$ is the outer product. The expectation
value of a state $[s]$ is given by $\langle [s] \rangle = \text{tr}{\rho [s]}$,


Consider a player $i$ with associated ball $B_i$ and graph $SIG_i$. Also consider that the ball $B_i$ has nonzero flux
at the boundery, and so $i$ is at the same time in an uncertain state. The
density matrix used here is defined to be the statistical state of a system in
quantum mechanics, and is particularly useful in dealing with mixed states.

We have an immersion in the surrounding
dynamical complex field $\mathbb{C}^2$. The complex field encases the distributions of the
player strategies; that is, the gradient of the distribution across the boundary
determines the orientation of exterior.

TODO:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create hyperbola in Minkowski space
\item Linearize node types using retraction (almost homogenous) using Lorentz
time-invariance 
\item Partition function to the product space
\item Start with identical particles (blank slate)
\item Define progression of belief (use the alleles?)
\item Mutate to generate attacks with fixed binomial dist (of attack type)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evolved CRN (eCRN)}
CLAIM: We now show that the process cycle of the eCR adhers to the evolutionary
model. (evolved CRN)
\begin{itemize}
\item The manifold of the eCRs network is factorially bounded above by its
most exterior exponent, i.e. there exists a calibration on $\mcX$,
$$
\frac{\omega^k}{k!},
$$    
and therfore, the topology of the sublayer of the CRN is a simplectic
manifold $(\mcX,\omega)$. 
\item The eCRs are type invariant.
\item The exterior is continuous on the field.
\end{itemize}


The mobius triangles are subject to a piecewise skew transform, and
define a mapping function. We may assume that the the decision framework of
the eCRs is a skew function with respect to the flux conditions on the boundary
of
the surrounding field. 
{
\lemma{Existence and Contraction of a Kahler Manifold/ Mean Field Chaoticity}
}
\textbf{Proof:}
The fully connected and closed queueing system is fully
embedded in the frequency space. The emedding, along with the uncertainty
overlay allows us to formally represent the heterogenous eCRs. 
We will show that the decoupling of a distributed competitive game 
and the resulting niche market, a deformation of the space as the distribution
of density in the SIG manifold tends towards the central limit. Consider the
connected map generated on the skew plane, the flow of the phase space will
is diverted by the skew force, and may not lie on the outer hull, breaking
its convexity and introducing a nonlinear component to the smooth hull as
the tensor flow interacts with the surrounding field.
(FINISH)
\emph{Corollary:}
Every complex submanifold of a Kahler mainfold is volume minimizing in its
homology class.

TODO:
1. model the flux as the magnetic
component of the phase induced by the boundary potential (will be a plane)

The resulting topology is invariant under discrete possibility, and allows for
the weak convergence of our cadlag functor. Consider the infintesimal interval, 
$$
    dS^2 = dS_i^2 - dS_j^2,
$$
of strategies.

\section{Survivability}

In this section, we focus on vulnerabilites to denial-of-service (DoS) threats in the hostile network environment due to the uncertainties in the licensed user detection made during the spectrum sensing interval.
Our model assumes the existence of a hostile network environment, defined by the
presence our threat models, consisting of two types of attack: explicit or
implicit attacks. Explicit attacks include jamming, masking... Defense against
an explicit attack requires that the network detect an adversary hiding in the
PU spectrum. Implicit attacks are concerned with corruption of the decision
making process of the eCR. 
operating as an agent of the PU. As the adversary nodes are agents of the PU,
they are assumed to have knowledge of the characteristics of the PU's signal in
advance. The adverserial CPEs (ACPEs) therefore have an advantage as they do not
need to approximate the PU signal for detection. The adversary nodes are
classified according to their attacks and modeled as a Bayesian attack graph
(BAG). Describing the CRN similarly, we allocate defensive attributes to the eCR network graph, effectively forming an integrated defense system (IDS). We then form a Stackelberg game and derive bounds on the stability/ survivablility of the CRN.
W evaluate the performances of the IDS using the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability that an alert raised by the IDS represents an actual intrusion. 
We begin with an introduction to the Stackelberg game from a topological
perspectiv game from a topological perspective, and show that a SOLUTION exists
and is a solution to the heirarchical game.

In particular, the overlapping areas of the individual CRN will have 
difficulty in enforcing security. 

\subsection{The Stackelberg Topology}

(EDIT)


 $\gamma$ defines cherry-picking and
time-constrained player types as separate distributions, and forms a partition
of the space where mixed strategy vector 


We determine the fitness function as the action of a pair interaction between
players, following the replicator dynamics model for a haploid species. 
Thus, the fitness of a player is determined by the result of pair interactions,
and can be represented by the index $(i,j)^n$ in the
resulting $2^n$ matrix. Consider,
$$
    \theta(L_i,L_{-i}) = \displaystyle\sum_{j\in\L_{-i}}
    (1-L_i)(1-L_j)\theta)_{L_{-i}} + L_i L_j \theta_{i}.
$$
Let the private preferences of a player be defined by $\theta \in [0,1]^{L_i}$,
$$
    \theta(s_i, s_{-i}) = \displaystyle\sum_{L_i \in s_i} \theta_i(L_i, L_{-i})\theta_i.
$$

As our group is a matrix \emph{Lie} group, and also a finite-dimensional
smooth manifold.
